## Inline gifs / images

- gifs:
    - `gif-for-cli`
        - linux / macos.
        - `pip install gif-for-cli; gif-for-cli ./foo.gif -c â–ˆ`
        - looks kinda bad, takes time to cache
    - kitty icat
        - `kitty icat --align=left ./foo.gif`
        - perfect
- images:
    - ImageMagick?
    - image-to-ansi.py, 11 years old: https://gist.github.com/klange/1687427

## General Brain dump

- [ ] (sub)pages can reference other (sub)pages (simple `import` maybe? or directive?)
- [ ] "See also: blabla" is clickable (`Textual`)
- [ ] in README.md: "optimized for zero mental overhead, specifically when getting to the info"

## `Page`

- Can this be ast parsed? when `tw ws`

```python
def ws():
    # https://example.com
```

- [ ] **aliases** for everything, even sub_pages. like rst directives?

# Done

- [x] fuzziness with fzf
- [x] support for nested sub_pages (e.g. `docker images ps`)
- [x] a `python` **submodule** is a page, and it contains functions which are sub_pages etc
- [x] Refactoring:
    - [x] migrate all pages in main.py to separate files
    - [x] `populator.py`
        - [x] find a better name about playing with functions
        - [x] move from main.py functions like `get_skipped_sub_pages` to it
- [x] [perf] Populate (sub)page lazily, only on demand
